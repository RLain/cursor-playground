## Documentation for Sanity
To interact with Sanity for fetching, publishing, updating, and deleting posts, you'll typically use the @sanity/client package. Here's a basic skeleton to get you started with these operations:
1. Setup Sanity Client
First, ensure you have the @sanity/client package installed. You can install it using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install @sanity/client
```
2. Initialize the Sanity Client
Create a file, for example, sanityClient.js, to initialize the Sanity client:
```js
import sanityClient from '@sanity/client';

const client = sanityClient({
  projectId: 'yourProjectId', // replace with your project ID
  dataset: 'yourDataset', // replace with your dataset name
  useCdn: true, // `false` if you want to ensure fresh data
  apiVersion: '2023-10-01', // use a date string
});

export default client;
```
3. Fetch Posts
To fetch posts, you can use a GROQ query:
```js
// lib/fetchPosts.js
import client from './sanityClient';

export const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const query = `*[_type == "post"]{
    _id,
    title,
    slug,
    body,
    mainImage,
    categories[]->title,
    tags,
    publishedAt
  }`;

  const posts = await client.fetch(query);
  return posts;
};
```
4. Publish a Post
To publish a post, you need to create or update a document:
```js
// lib/publishPost.js
import client from './sanityClient';

export const publishPost = async (post) => {
  const result = await client.createOrReplace({
    _type: 'post',
    ...post,
  });

  return result;
};
```
5. Update a Post
To update a post, you can use the patch method:
```js
// lib/updatePost.js
import client from './sanityClient';

export const updatePost = async (postId, updates) => {
  const result = await client
    .patch(postId)
    .set(updates)
    .commit();

  return result;
};
```
6. Delete a Post
To delete a post, use the delete method:
```js
// lib/deletePost.js
import client from './sanityClient';

export const deletePost = async (postId) => {
  const result = await client.delete(postId);
  return result;
};
```
